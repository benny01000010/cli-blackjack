# cli-blackjack
Welcome to cli-blackjack, the game that allows you to play a proper game of Blackjack straight from your terminal window.
Simply clone this repository and make blackjack.sh executable (if it isn't already) and get started.

As is per usual, you will be playing against a "dealer" who will always hit if he has less than 17 points in his hand. 

PLEASE NOTE that this game will CLEAR YOUR TERMINAL upon starting a new game. 
If you DO NOT want your screen cleared change the clear_screen variable at the top of blackjack.sh to false.

Game stats will be displayed when you are done playing, so don't CTRL+C! Instead, enter "n" when you are prompted to play again.

# Development
- Add some color to your terminal
- Add backround music and sound effects (maybe)
- Add ASCII card art
- Bugfixes and code optimizations
