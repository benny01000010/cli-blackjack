# cli-blackjack
Welcome to cli-blackjack, the game that allows you to play a proper game of Blackjack straight from your terminal window.
Simply clone this repository and make blackjack.sh executable (if it isn't already) and get started.

As is per usual, you will be playing against a "dealer" who will always hit if he has less than 17 points in his hand. 

# Development
- Add some color to your terminal
- Add backround music and sound effects (once I can find some good royalty free clips)
- Add ASCII card art
- Bugfixes and code optimizations
